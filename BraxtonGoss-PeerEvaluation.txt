Group Members: Braxton Goss & Elijah Shaw

Elijah and I worked together on all files and stuck to a daily schedule that included 
many hours of pair programming. We made it so each of us would be the one "driving" and "watching"
during pair programming an equal amount so one person didn't feel like they were doing too much or too little.
